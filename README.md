# Face-Swap-using-Stable-Diffusion-Inpainting
This project implements a face-swapping technique using the Stable Diffusion Inpainting Pipeline and OpenCV for face detection. The approach combines face detection and image inpainting to transfer a face from a source image onto a target image, using deep learning models for seamless blending.
